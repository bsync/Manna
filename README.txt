PURPOSE:
Manna is intended to become a full-fledged Bible study application.  The goal
is is to provide a tool that encourages good Bible study methodology by
focusing on rightly dividing the Bible. Ultimately I want to glorify my Lord
and Saviour, Jesus Christ, by writing software that is well thought out and
useful.

PHILOSOPHY:
The Bible teaches us to take every thought captive for Christ. In many ways
software is the epitome of captured thought. It is the thinking of a man
captured in a volition-less computer. I have often marvelled at how such a
machine with no will or emotion of its own can invoke such willful responses
(both positive and negative) from the users it was intended to serve. Obviously
the thought process of the developers are at work in the creation of the
software and those thoughts, either good or bad, are bound to affect the users
in some way.  Afterall, we are all made in God's image and that in itself is a
very powerful thing. It stands to reason that our God given intellect will
have affect on others.  As we attempt to solve problems either biblically or,
more often, from a human view point perspective we affect those around us and
cause either edification or dammage. I believe that by investing prayerfully
and thoughtfully in the code that makes up Manna it will become a powerful
tool for understanding my Creator better and will lead to rightly dividing the
Word of God and edifying myself and my fellow saints. I think that it will be
the most important software I will ever write and I am hopeful that it will
inspire others to both study the Bible and apply biblical thinking to their own
projects be they software or otherwise.
