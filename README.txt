PURPOSE:
MannaCanon is intended to become a full fledged bible study application. 
Currently it only supports basic browsing of the King James bible text.
Eventually I plan to add functionality to support more in depth study tools.
The point is to provide a tool that encourages good Bible study methodology.
Ultimately the goal is to glorify my Lord and Saviour: Jesus Christ!

DESIGN NOTES:
The design is initially supporting the Android mobile computing platforms.
It is my intent to develop the MannaCanon software using a TDD methodology. 
TDD is short for Test Driven Development (see wikipedia).
There are currently 12 unit tests assoicated with the project.
The 'test' target is the default build target of the included Makefile.

BUILD NOTES:
I build on a linux box.
I have made no attempt to support other development platforms at this time.
The Makefile is intended to be the main build interface.
Simply running 'make' from the command line should build the system.
The Makefile currently attempts to resolve some but not all dependencies.
Ideally the Makefile could be used to bootstrap the entire dev environment.

PHILOSOPHY:
The Bible teaches us to take every thought captive for Christ. In many ways
software is the epitome of captured thought. It is the thinking of a man
captured in a volition-less computer. I have often marvelled at how a machine
with no will or emotion of its own can invoke such willful responses (both
positive and negative) from the users it was intended to serve. Obviously the
thought process of the developers are at work in the creation of the software
and those thoughts, good or bad, are bound to affect the users in some way.
Afterall, we are made in God's image and that in itself is a very powerful
thing. It stands to reason that our God given intellect will affect others.
As we attempt to solve problems either biblically or, more often, from a human
view point perspective we affect those around us and cause either edification
or dammage. I believe that by investing prayerfully and thoughtfully in the
code that makes up MannaCanon it will become a powerful tool for understanding
my Creator better. I think that it will be the most important software I will
ever write and I am hopeful that it will inspire others to both study the Bible
and apply biblical thinking to their own projects be they software or
otherwise.
